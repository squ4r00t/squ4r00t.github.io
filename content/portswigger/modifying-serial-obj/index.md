This lab uses a serialization-based session mechanism and is vulnerable to privilege escalation as a result. To solve the lab, edit the serialized object in the session cookie to exploit this vulnerability and gain administrative privileges. Then, delete the user `carlos`.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

### Solving the lab
___

To solve the lab, let's first login as `wiener` using the provided credentials.

Once logged in, we notice that we get a base64 encoded cookie:

{{<figure src="/img/portswigger/insecure_deserial/modifying_serial_obj/cookie.png" position=center caption="Base64 encode cookie">}}

After decoding it, we get the following PHP serialized object:

```text
O:4:"User":2:{s:8:"username";s:6:"wiener";s:5:"admin";b:0;}
```

This is an object of the class `User` containing 2 attributes: 
- `username`: string set to the value "wiener"
- `admin`: boolean set to False (0)

Let's try to set the `admin` attribute to `True`, re-encode the object and update the value of our cookie:

```text
O:4:"User":2:{s:8:"username";s:6:"wiener";s:5:"admin";b:1;}
```

If we refresh the page, we can see that we now have access to the admin panel where we can delete the user `carlos` and solve the lab:
