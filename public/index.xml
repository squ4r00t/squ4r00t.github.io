      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oouch is a hard difficulty Linux machine featuring web applications that use the OAuth authorization framework. Absence of a CSRF Token is leveraged to link an administrative account to our account, providing access to sensitive information. This information is used to register a new client application and steal the authorization code. This code is used to gain an access token, which provides unrestricted access to user resources. A misconfigured DBus server is then exploited through uWSGI in order to execute code in the context of root.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CTF is an insane difficulty Linux box with a web application using LDAP based authentication. The application is vulnerable to LDAP injection but due to character blacklisting the payloads need to be double URL encoded. After enumeration, a token string is found, which is obtained using boolean injection. Using the token an OTP can be generated, which allows for execution of commands. After establishing a foothold, a cron can be exploited to gain sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Port scanning through network pivots</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever tried scanning ports on a machine present in an internal network through a pivot machine, you might have noticed that it can be very slow at times and that the results of the scan aren&amp;rsquo;t always very reliable (missing open ports :/).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once solution that comes to mind might be to transfer nmap (or another port scanner) on the pivot machine and then run the scan from there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
