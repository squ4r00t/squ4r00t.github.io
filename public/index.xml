      <title>Portswigger - Cache Poisoning DOM XSS</title>

      <description>Lab Description This lab contains a DOM-based vulnerability that can be exploited as part of a web cache poisoning attack. A user visits the home page roughly once a minute. Note that the cache used by this lab has stricter criteria for deciding which responses are cacheable, so you will need to study the cache behavior closely.&#xA;To solve the lab, poison the cache with a response that executes alert(document.cookie) in the visitor&amp;rsquo;s browser.</description>

      <title>Extended Euclidian Algorithm Explained</title>

      <description>In this blog post, I explain the Euclidian Algorithm (+extended) and how to implement them in python.&#xA;Prerequisite: Modulus Operator First, we need to understand the modulus operator.&#xA;The modulus operator, often represented by the percent character (%) in many programming languages, returns the rest of the division between 2 operands.&#xA;For example, let&amp;rsquo;s say we have 2 integers a=5 and b=2. Then a mod b will be equal to 1</description>

      <title>SPS: A convenient way of scanning through network pivots</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever tried scanning ports on a machine present in an internal network through a pivot machine, you might have noticed that it can be very slow at times and that the results of the scan aren&amp;rsquo;t always very reliable (often times missing open ports :/).&#xA;Once solution that comes to mind might be to transfer nmap (or another port scanner) on the pivot machine and then run the scan from there.</description>

      <title>HTB - Oouch</title>

      <description>Overview Oouch is a hard difficulty Linux machine featuring web applications that use the OAuth authorization framework. Absence of a CSRF Token is leveraged to link an administrative account to our account, providing access to sensitive information. This information is used to register a new client application and steal the authorization code. This code is used to gain an access token, which provides unrestricted access to user resources. A misconfigured DBus server is then exploited through uWSGI in order to execute code in the context of root.</description>

      <title>HTB - CTF</title>

      <description>CTF is an insane difficulty Linux box with a web application using LDAP based authentication. The application is vulnerable to LDAP injection but due to character blacklisting the payloads need to be double URL encoded. After enumeration, a token string is found, which is obtained using boolean injection. Using the token an OTP can be generated, which allows for execution of commands. After establishing a foothold, a cron can be exploited to gain sensitive information.</description>
