      <description>In this blog post, I explain the Euclidian Algorithm (+extended) and how to implement them in python.&#xA;Prerequisite: Modulus Operator First, we need to understand the modulus operator.&#xA;The modulus operator, often represented by the percent character (%) in many programming languages, returns the rest of the division between 2 operands.&#xA;For example, let&amp;rsquo;s say we have 2 integers a=5 and b=2. Then a mod b will be equal to 1</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever tried scanning ports on a machine present in an internal network through a pivot machine, you might have noticed that it can be very slow at times and that the results of the scan aren&amp;rsquo;t always very reliable (often times missing open ports :/).&#xA;Once solution that comes to mind might be to transfer nmap (or another port scanner) on the pivot machine and then run the scan from there.</description>
