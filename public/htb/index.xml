      <description>Overview This machine starts with a nextjs website that is found vulnerable to CVE-2025-29927. Exploiting this, we are to bypass authentication and access an api endpoint that allows us to read local files on the server. This is leveraged to retrieve the password of the user jeremy and login to the box. This user is able to run the terraform binary with sudo, this can be exploited in order to get root access to the box.</description>

      <description>Overview Oouch is a hard difficulty Linux machine featuring web applications that use the OAuth authorization framework. Absence of a CSRF Token is leveraged to link an administrative account to our account, providing access to sensitive information. This information is used to register a new client application and steal the authorization code. This code is used to gain an access token, which provides unrestricted access to user resources. A misconfigured DBus server is then exploited through uWSGI in order to execute code in the context of root.</description>

      <description>CTF is an insane difficulty Linux box with a web application using LDAP based authentication. The application is vulnerable to LDAP injection but due to character blacklisting the payloads need to be double URL encoded. After enumeration, a token string is found, which is obtained using boolean injection. Using the token an OTP can be generated, which allows for execution of commands. After establishing a foothold, a cron can be exploited to gain sensitive information.</description>
